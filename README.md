# What is Klocka?
Klocka is an app (iOS/iPadOs/Android) that allows retailers to set up a virtual doorbell to simplify entering their premises for people in need of help. The principle of the app is simple: The retailer gets a sticker that says that you only have to scan the QR code to ring the bell to get help. When the QR code is scanned, the person seeking help is directed to a website and the app from the store owner "rings" (a doorbell is used as an app notification). Then the owner knows they can help someone at the door. 

The idea is inspired by the amazing project [Viersen für Alle](https://www.instagram.com/viersenfueralle/), where this solution was implemented very successfully with physical bells. The app aims to be a cost-effective (only costs are the stickers) and quickly implementable alternative to physical bells, however, it also clearly has its limits and disadvantages. 
The app is still under development. Currently we have the first version ready with which we debug and develop new ideas. In other words, we are currently in the alpha testing phase, but hope to be able to do the first beta test soon. Also the repository is still in work to be implemented reasonably.
